# Context-Free Grammar Equivalence

Establishing the equivalence of two Context-Free Grammars is defined by equating their respective outputs. This definition of equivalence expands into a complex problem due to the unbounded nature of the outputs that need to be compared. Yet the structure stemming from Context-Free Grammars allows for more sophisticated algorithms to be developed. This project focuses on developing new algorithms as well as producing open-source implementations for some existing algorithms.

## Overview

 - implementations contain the different equivalence algorithms
 - tests contain the unit tests
 - timing_tests contain the core timing system as well as some set up tests
 - misc among other things contains plot scripts for the various csv files generated by the tests
 - tools.py contains other helper functions such as data loaders and converters
 - cfg.py contains data type definitions for the Context-Free Grammars


## Setup
Please install all required packages
```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

Note: some of the code will only work on Windows due to comparability issues such as file path syntax
