# comparing_CFGs

Queen Mary University of London 3rd year project. The goal of this project is to develop new and more efficient algorithms for comparing Context Free Grammars (CFGs).

## Overview

 - implementations contain the different equivalence algorithms
 - tests contain the unit tests
 - timing_tests contain the core timing system as well as some set up tests
 - misc among other things contains plot scripts for the various csv files generated by the tests
 - tools.py contains other helper functions such as data loaders and converters
 - cfg.py contains data type definitions for the Context-Free Grammars


## Setup
Please install all required packages
```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

Note: some of the code will only work on Windows due to comparability issues such as file path syntax
