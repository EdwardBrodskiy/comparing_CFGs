From Automating Grammar Comparison

Type 1 Errors. We construct Gm by removing one production of G chosen at random. In this case, L(Gm) 
âŠ† L(G). The inclusion is proper only if the production that is removed is not redundant.

Type 2 Errors. We create Gm by choosing (at random) one production of G having at least two non-terminals, 
and removing (at random) one non-terminal from the righthand-side. In this case, neither L(Gm) nor L(G) has 
to necessarily include the other.

Type 3 Errors. We construct Gm as follows. We randomly choose one production of the grammar, say P, having at 
least two non-terminals, and also choose one non-terminal of the right-hand-side, say N. We then create rule_a copy 
(say N0) of the non-terminal N that has every production of N except one (determined at random). We replace N 
by N0 in the production P.
